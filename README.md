# Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm

This project was just from my curiousity on how the particle swarm optimization algorithm works. After lerning it (and a couple of other optimization algorithm), I decided to test it on a problem I am quite good with, which is linear regression. Here, I try to solve a polynomial regression problem using particle swarm optimization algorithm. I did a few tests to understand how various factors affect how fast we get the expected solutions to the polynomial regression using particle optimization algorithm.
